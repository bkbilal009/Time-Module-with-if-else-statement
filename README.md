ðŸ•’ Time-Based Greetings with datetime

In this project, I explored Pythonâ€™s datetime module to create a simple reminder program that greets the user based on the current time of day.
Instead of writing static messages, the program dynamically checks the systemâ€™s clock and responds with:

Good Morning (5 AM â€“ 12 PM)

Good Afternoon (12 PM â€“ 5 PM)

Good Evening (5 PM â€“ 8 PM)

Good Night (8 PM â€“ onwards)

This project may look small, but it carries a big lesson:

Real-world applications often rely on time-based logic

Learning to use built-in modules like datetime makes code more powerful and practical

Even a beginner-level script can be turned into something meaningful with a little creativity

By building this, Iâ€™m not just practicing Python syntax â€” Iâ€™m learning how to think like a developer who solves real-world problems with simple, elegant solutions. This mindset is what I want to keep growing as I move towards my goal of joining world-class engineering teams.
